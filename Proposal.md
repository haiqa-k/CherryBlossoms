#Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I plan on creating a procedurally generated tree. What makes this tree unique is that it is emulating cherry blossom. The inspiration for this came from the spring on Bryn Mawr College campus. Since trees and flowers have self-similarity (recursive structure), I will make use of recursive algorithms with L-system grammars. For the tree branches, I will create random variations to scaled-down subparts.
